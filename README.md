# math_expression
A class to define "mathematical expressions", so that computers can understand them the same way human mathematicians would.

This repository is under construction.

I am considering using the programming language "Raku", so I am currently reading the book "Think Raku", freely available [here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-perl-6/).

## My thoughts while reading the book "Think Raku"
I think I chose well while considering the programming language "Raku", after all, I want the result of 0.3-0.2-0.1 to be zero, and according to the book, this is not naturally the case in Java, C and Python. So if I want a foundation for a system describing theoretical mathematics, the "numerical infrastructure" in Raku seems pretty good.
